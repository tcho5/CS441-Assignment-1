Description:
Program 1: Hello World, due Midnight, January 30th.
In either Android or iOS, write a simple app that displays a Hello World message, and that does something when you tap on a button. It doesn't have to be complex. It doesn't have to be a big app. Be a little bit creative, play around a bit, get familiar with the build system, the IDE, have some fun. The goal here is to build something, and have it run as an app on one of the two platforms. For the course, you'll need to do a couple of projects on Android, and a couple on iOS -- this might be an easy project to do on a platform that will be more of a hassle for you to program on

Application Idea:

This simple application generates the Hello World Display with a button that allows a user to generate a random meme. With each click, a random meme appears. The meme images are stored locally into the program file directories.
