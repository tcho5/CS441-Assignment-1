IOS Version of Assignment 1 for CS441 - Binghamton University

Description:
Program 1: Hello World, due Midnight, January 30th.
In either Android or iOS, write a simple app that displays a Hello World message, and that does something when you tap on a button. It doesn't have to be complex. It doesn't have to be a big app. Be a little bit creative, play around a bit, get familiar with the build system, the IDE, have some fun. The goal here is to build something, and have it run as an app on one of the two platforms. For the course, you'll need to do a couple of projects on Android, and a couple on iOS -- this might be an easy project to do on a platform that will be more of a hassle for you to program on
